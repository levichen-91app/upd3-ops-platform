# Feature Specification: Notification Status Devices API

**Feature Branch**: `008-docs-notification-status`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ÂèÉËÄÉ @docs/notification-status-proxy-api.yaml @docs/notification-status-error-handling.md @docs/notification-status-config-simple.md

ÊàëË¶ÅÈñãÁôº /api/v1/notification-status/devices ÈÄôÊîØ API"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Analyzed: User wants to develop a notification status devices API
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: device query API, notification status, shop and phone parameters
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No major clarifications needed - documentation is comprehensive
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: query devices by shop ID and phone number
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable based on provided specs
6. Identify Key Entities (device data)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: All requirements clear from documentation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Operations team members need to query device information for specific shop customers to investigate notification delivery issues. When a customer reports not receiving push notifications, the operations team uses the customer's shop ID and phone number to retrieve all registered devices for that customer.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid shop ID and phone number, **When** requesting device information, **Then** the system returns all registered devices for that customer including device tokens, platform types, and registration details
2. **Given** an invalid shop ID (negative or zero), **When** requesting device information, **Then** the system returns a validation error with clear error message
3. **Given** a valid shop ID but non-existent phone number, **When** requesting device information, **Then** the system returns a "not found" response indicating no devices were found
4. **Given** a malformed phone number, **When** requesting device information, **Then** the system returns a validation error specifying the correct phone format

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Marketing Cloud service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does system handle timeout scenarios when external API is slow?
- What response format is returned when a customer has no registered devices?
- How are rate limiting scenarios from external services handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept shop ID and phone number as query parameters for device lookup
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that shop ID is a positive integer greater than 0
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate phone number format using pattern '^[0-9+\\-\\s()]+$' with length between 8-15 characters
- **FR-004**: System MUST query Marketing Cloud Device API to retrieve customer device information
- **FR-005**: System MUST return device data including GUID, UDID, token, platform, member ID, app version, and timestamps
- **FR-006**: System MUST return standardized success response format with success flag, data array, timestamp, and request ID
- **FR-007**: System MUST return standardized error response format for validation failures, not found scenarios, and external service errors
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle external API timeouts (10 seconds) gracefully with appropriate error messaging
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate unique request IDs for tracking and debugging purposes
- **FR-010**: System MUST return HTTP 200 for successful device retrieval
- **FR-011**: System MUST return HTTP 400 for parameter validation failures
- **FR-012**: System MUST return HTTP 404 when no devices are found for the given parameters
- **FR-013**: System MUST return HTTP 500 for internal server errors or external service failures
- **FR-014**: System MUST require 'ny-operator' header for authentication and return HTTP 401 if missing or invalid
- **FR-015**: System MUST fail immediately on Marketing Cloud API errors without retry attempts
- **FR-016**: System MUST log all device query requests and responses at INFO level including request ID, parameters, and response status
- **FR-017**: System MUST handle up to 10 devices per customer query within the 10-second timeout and return all found devices within this expected range

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Device**: Represents a customer's mobile device registered for push notifications, containing unique identifiers (GUID, UDID), push token, platform type (iOS/Android), associated member ID, app version, and creation/update timestamps
- **Customer**: Identified by combination of shop ID and phone number, can have multiple registered devices
- **Shop**: Business entity identified by shop ID, contains multiple customers with their devices

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: What specific timeout value should trigger the "graceful timeout handling" mentioned in FR-008? ‚Üí A: 10 seconds (balanced approach)
- Q: What authentication/authorization method should the operations team use to access this API? ‚Üí A: only use 'ny-operator' header
- Q: How many retry attempts should the system make when the Marketing Cloud API fails before giving up? ‚Üí A: No retries (fail immediately)
- Q: What logging level should be used for tracking device query requests and responses? ‚Üí A: INFO (basic request/response tracking)
- Q: What is the expected maximum number of devices that could be returned for a single customer query? ‚Üí A: 10 devices (power user with multiple devices)

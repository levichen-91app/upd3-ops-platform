# Research: 通知活動歷程查詢 API

**Feature**: `/api/v1/notification-status/history/{notificationId}`
**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Branch**: `009-api-v1-notification`

## Research Overview

All technical context was clearly defined from existing codebase analysis and constitutional requirements. No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items require resolution.

## Technology Decisions

### 1. NestJS Framework Integration

**Decision**: Extend existing notification-status module with new controller method
**Rationale**:
- Reuses established module structure and patterns
- Leverages existing authentication guards and filters
- Maintains consistency with current codebase architecture
- Follows NestJS best practices for controller organization

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate dedicated module: Rejected due to minimal scope and code duplication
- Generic proxy module: Rejected due to lack of business context

### 2. External API Integration Pattern

**Decision**: Create dedicated WhaleApiService with interface abstraction
**Rationale**:
- Follows constitutional requirement for dependency abstraction
- Enables easy testing with mock implementations
- Provides type safety for external API responses
- Allows future extension for other Whale API endpoints

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct HTTP calls in controller: Rejected due to coupling concerns
- Generic HTTP service: Rejected due to lack of domain-specific logic

### 3. Authentication Strategy

**Decision**: Reuse existing ny-operator guard implementation
**Rationale**:
- Maintains consistency with existing endpoints
- Proven authentication mechanism already in place
- Follows DRY principle
- Reduces implementation and testing overhead

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Create new authentication mechanism: Rejected due to unnecessary complexity
- Skip authentication: Rejected due to security requirements

### 4. Error Handling Approach

**Decision**: Implement immediate 500 response for Whale API failures
**Rationale**:
- Based on clarification session requirements
- Provides clear failure semantics for external dependency issues
- Avoids complexity of retry mechanisms or caching
- Aligns with user expectation for batch/background processing

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Retry with exponential backoff: Rejected per clarification
- Return cached data: Rejected per clarification
- Queue for later processing: Rejected per clarification

### 5. Response Format Standardization

**Decision**: Use existing ApiResponse/ApiErrorResponse patterns
**Rationale**:
- Maintains API consistency across all endpoints
- Provides standardized request tracking with requestId
- Follows established error classification (500 vs 404)
- Supports existing client expectations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom response format: Rejected due to inconsistency
- Plain JSON responses: Rejected due to lack of tracking capability

### 6. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Jest + Supertest integration tests with service-level mocking
**Rationale**:
- Follows constitutional testing standards
- Uses overrideProvider pattern for external dependency mocking
- Enables comprehensive scenario coverage
- Maintains test isolation and reliability

**Alternatives Considered**:
- HTTP-level mocking (nock): Rejected per constitutional prohibition
- Unit tests only: Rejected due to insufficient coverage for integration scenarios

### 7. Performance Considerations

**Decision**: 5-second timeout with no specific concurrency limits
**Rationale**:
- Based on clarification session requirements
- Appropriate for batch/background processing use case
- Relies on infrastructure-level scaling
- Avoids premature optimization

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Aggressive timeout (<1s): Rejected due to external API constraints
- Custom concurrency limiting: Rejected per clarification

## Implementation Readiness

**Status**: ✅ Ready for Phase 1 Design
**Rationale**: All technology choices align with constitutional requirements and clarified business needs. No research gaps remain.

**Next Steps**: Proceed to data model design and contract generation.
